A passive measure of human intent is used to blend the human and machine inputs in a mixed initiative approach. The blending law is combined with saturated super-twisting sliding mode speed and heading controllers, so that exogenous disturbances can be counteracted via equivalent control. It is proven that when the proposed blending law is used, the combined control signals from both the human and automatic controller respect the actuator magnitude constraints of the machine. To demonstrate the approach, shared control experiments are performed using an unmanned ground vehicle, which follows a lawn mower pattern shaped path.},

abstract = {The aim of the project in which this work was conceived is the design of a climbing robot for pruning spruce trees without damaging the bark. According to the requirements and pruning methods for avoiding the flaws of the finished timber, guidelines and constraints for the mechatronic design of a new climbing robot for spruce-pruning activities were deduced. A 3-wheeled-driven system able to cope with the tree bark thanks to compression springs is chosen for the first functional design; a force-balance analysis is performed for understanding the climbing and equilibrium requirements also considering the additional weight of a pruning system installed on a cart moving on a guide placed on the robot main structure. The quasi-static model, the mechanical design and the related electronic and driver systems are here presented. The preliminary scaled mechatronic prototype is experimentally evaluated on poles with diameters in the range of the young spruces, i.e. 100\textendash200Â mm, in its main climbing features. These results will serve as basis for the further development of the system.},

In case of disagreement, the human user may exert a significant amount of effort opposing the robotic counterpart. Therefore, a prompt assessment of user intent is of the utmost importance in shared systems. In this paper a novel strategy, inspired by anti-windup techniques, is proposed to adjust the component of automatic control according to the sensed human effort. A haptic human-robot interface is developed and the method is validated in a shared control application in which both the human user and the automatic controller can steer a simulated ground vehicle. Evidence is shown that the proposed method can reduce the required human effort, with performance comparable to the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {This paper describes the trajectory tracking of an underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with three control inputs (surge, yaw and pitch moment) that operates in the presence of time-varying disturbances. The AUV kinematics are described in global coordinates as a Hamiltonian system on the Lie group SE(3) and the boundary-value problem arising from the geometric framing of Pontryaginâs Maximum Principle is applied to the vehicle kinematics. This 6-dimensional boundary value problem is solved using a numerical shooting method and a novel semi-analytical Lie group integrator. The integrator uses Rodrigueâs formula to express the exact solution of the solution curves, is symplectic and preserves energy and momentum. Inverse dynamics is applied to construct an inner-loop controller, which accounts for constraints on maximum torque and force via time reparametrization. This inner-loop control, which would drive the AUV along the reference trajectory in perfect conditions, is combined with a disturbance observer to construct an outer-loop controller, which ensures stability in the presence of bounded disturbances. Simulation results complete the work.},

abstract = {In human-robot shared control, control authority is sharedÂ between human operators and automatic systems. SwitchingÂ from one state to another can make the overall system unstable,Â even though the stability in each state is guaranteed. ThisÂ issue is investigated in simulation using a Lane Keeping AssistÂ System (LKAS), which guides a vehicle along a lane, while allowingÂ lane changes, if desired by the human. An interface allowsÂ a human to input a steering control signal with a joystickÂ and provides visual feedback of lane-position. The total steeringÂ command is the combination of the LKAS control signal andÂ the human steering input. System performance is explored as theÂ vehicle switches among different levels of cooperation betweenÂ the human and the automatic driving system. The minimum timeÂ permitted between lane changes is an important parameter. AsÂ this time is decreased, user intent and the automatic controllerÂ are in conflict more often, resulting in larger control efforts fromÂ both user and automatic controller.},

abstract = {When dealing with unmanned agricultural vehicles (remotely-controlled vehicles, robots), vision systems are a key-factor for implementing field-solutions having direct interactions with crops. Among all the possible information given by a vision system, the punctual estimation of the canopy volume is surely an interesting parameter: it is related to the crop vegetative status and, hence, it is fundamental for performing and setting-up properly some important field-operations (e.g., pruning/thinning, spraying). A system able to recognize the canopy volume can provide either the input-signals for implementing a robotic real-time site-specific farming system or relevant information for a proper crop management. However, there are many practical difficulties in the field implementation of such a system: complex canopy shapes, different colours, textures and illumination conditions with projected shadows. Terrestrial/aerial vision systems working on visible-light wavelengths and/or 2D-images of crops, although capable of excellent performances, have a computationally-heavy post-processing; therefore, they are unsuitable for implementing low-cost real-time servo-actuated cropping systems (e.g., robotised sprayers). Instead, a vision system composed by two LiDAR sensors aligned vertically, scanning the same targets, could give a sort of stereoscopic vision, here named âlateral-linear-stereoscopic visionâ. The aim of this study is assessing the opportunity to use such a system on an automatic or autonomous/robotised implement by performing some preliminary tests in a controlled environment. The resulting system is independent of the lighting conditions (it works also in the dark), is highly reliable (no projected shadows) and data processing is very fast. Although further studies are required to overcome the issues that could arise in a future field implementation, this system has all the premises to be successfully embedded in an automatized monitoring system.},

One of the most promising mobile robot architectures is the articulated 4-wheeled system that shows an optimal steering capacity, and the possibility to adapt to uneven terrains thanks to a central passive degree of freedom. In this paper, the kinematic and (quasi-)static model for evaluating the phase I instability presented in Baker and Guzzomi(2013) has been firstly extended to allow to threat a generic articulated robotic system and to forecast the instability conditions. Then, the model and the stability conditions have been implemented in a Matlabâ¢Â simulator and validated by means of an experimental emulator. Finally, a first prototype for a mechatronic anti-overturning device is discussed.},

abstract = {Progress in sensors, controllers and mechatronics devices and the development of (semi-) autonomous systems that can travel safely on uneven terrain and perform many operations has encouraged research interest in the use of robotics for agriculture and forestry in hilly and mountainous terrains. Here, the main mobile configurations that are likely to be used for robotic platforms as implement-carriers (3-wheeled, conventional/articulated 4-wheeled, tracked) were reviewed and discussed in terms of their suitability for agricultural operations and their stability. A numerical index accounting for the lateral stability of a vehicle, the roll stability index, was used to indicate the in-field working capacity of these platforms during side-slope operations. Assuming the same overall dimensions for all the configurations, the 3-wheel configuration, although very simple and agile, was seen as being the least stable, while a tracked vehicle was the most stable, although it had some important drawbacks when used in an agricultural context. This drawbacks included increased soil erosion and landslides caused by its tracks especially in the areas involving turning manoeuvres. The articulated system was found to be the most suitable for uneven and side-slope terrains because of its optimal steering capacity, agility and good stability. It was found to reach a critical stability angle close to the 4-wheel vehicle.},
